### Document Processing Implementation

**Existing Backend Note:** The backend already has document processing logic from a previous chatbot project. This will be adapted for Company Brain.

**Processing Flow:**

1. **Upload Handler** (`/api/documents/upload`)
   ```javascript
   // Receive file from frontend
   // Save to Supabase Storage
   // Create database record (status: 'processing')
   // Add job to Bull queue
   // Return document ID to frontend
   ```

2. **Queue Job** (Bull worker)
   ```javascript
   // Retrieve file from Supabase Storage
   // Extract text based on file type
   // Chunk text (512-1024 tokens, 50-100 overlap)
   // Generate embeddings for each chunk
   // Store embeddings in Pinecone with metadata
   // Update database (status: 'ready', chunk_count)
   // Send notification to admin
   ```

3. **Text Extraction**
   ```javascript
   // PDF: use pdf-parse
   // DOCX: use mammoth.js
   // MD/TXT: read directly with fs
   ```

4. **Chunking**
   ```javascript
   // Split text intelligently
   // Preserve paragraph boundaries
   // Add overlap for context
   // Target: 512-1024 tokens per chunk
   ```

5. **Embedding Generation**
   ```javascript
   // Use HuggingFace model (all-MiniLM)
   // Generate vector for each chunk
   // Normalize vectors
   ```

6. **Pinecone Storage**
   ```javascript
   // Upsert vectors with metadata:
   // - id: chunk_id
   // - values: embedding vector
   // - metadata: {doc_id, doc_name, folder, chunk_text, chunk_index}
   ```

---

### RAG Query Implementation

**Query Flow:**

1. **Receive Question** (`/api/chat/message`)
   ```javascript
   // Validate input
   // Get conversation history (last 5 messages)
   ```

2. **Check Cache** (Optional)
   ```javascript
   // Hash question
   // Check Redis for cached answer
   // If found, return cached response
   ```

3. **Generate Query Embedding**
   ```javascript
   // Use same HuggingFace model
   // Generate embedding for question
   ```

4. **Similarity Search**
   ```javascript
   // Query Pinecone with embedding
   // Retrieve top K chunks (K = 5-10, configurable)
   // Filter by similarity score (> threshold)
   ```

5. **Construct Prompt**
   ```javascript
   const prompt = `
   You are Company Brain, an AI assistant for [Company Name].
   Answer questions using ONLY the provided documents.
   If information is not in the documents, say so.
   
   Context from documents:
   ${retrievedChunks.map(c => c.text).join('\n\n')}
   
   Conversation history:
   ${conversationHistory}
   
   User question: ${userQuestion}
   
   Provide a helpful, accurate answer with proper formatting.
   `;
   ```

6. **Call Groq API** (via Vercel AI SDK)
   ```javascript
   import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
   import { streamText } from 'ai';
   
   const groq = createOpenAI({
     apiKey: process.env.GROQ_API_KEY,
     baseURL: 'https://api.groq.com/openai/v1',
   });
   
   const result = await streamText({
     model: groq(selectedModel), // admin configured
     messages: [
       { role: 'system', content: systemPrompt },
       ...conversationHistory,
       { role: 'user', content: userQuestion }
     ],
     temperature: configuredTemperature,
   });
   ```

7. **Stream Response**
   ```javascript
   // Stream tokens to frontend
   // Parse complete response
   // Extract sources used
   ```

8. **Save to Database**
   ```javascript
   // Save user message
   // Save assistant response with sources
   // Update conversation
   ```

9. **Cache Result** (Optional)
   ```javascript
   // Cache in Redis with TTL (1 hour)
   ```
