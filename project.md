# 🧠 Company Brain – AI-Powered Internal Knowledge & Productivity Platform

## 1. Introduction

Company Brain is an AI-powered internal knowledge and productivity platform designed for startups and growing companies. It transforms scattered company documents, policies, and technical information into a single intelligent system that answers employee questions, trains new hires, and gives management deep insights into organizational knowledge health.

Instead of employees searching through PDFs, Notion pages, Slack messages, and Google Docs, they simply ask Company Brain and get instant, accurate, and contextual answers.

## 2. The Problem We Are Solving

Modern companies face several serious internal challenges:

* Important information is scattered across multiple tools (Notion, Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, internal wikis)
* Employees repeatedly ask the same questions to HR and tech leads
* Documentation becomes outdated quickly
* New hires take months to become productive
* Managers have no visibility into what employees are confused about

This leads to:

* Wasted time
* Slower onboarding
* Lower productivity
* Increased load on HR and senior engineers

It:
